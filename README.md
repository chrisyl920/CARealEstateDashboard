Goal: To determine which zip codes have the highest growth rate for residential real estate.

Data to extract:

- Convert SF Government Data into a GeoJSON with gdal in order to build a choropleth map
  
Normalizing Data: 
-Account for Economic Recessions, Inflation,

Dashboard:
- Includes Interactive GeoSpatial Map of California for the user to select certain regions to see data on Sales Prices.
- A Slider exists for the user to choose the data of a desired year to view


Future Goals: 
- Expanding coverage to national then international
- Taking into account other factors that can predict future growth ie. location, city livability, etc.
